Pikhaya Smart Streets offers market intelligence to assess
the business potential in empty commercial property in urban
centres. We aggregate open data on local consumer purchasing 
behaviour and pedestrian footfall, as well as existing local 
business rent and salary expenditure, to offer insight into 
revenue potential for different categories of new business 
starts, and in cities across the UK.
</p>
<p>
Pikhaya is created and developed by 
<a href="http://www.whythawk.com">Whythawk</a>, an open data 
consulting, software and infrastructure development company.
We deliver capacity-building for open knowledge data services 
for governments, institutions and organisations.
