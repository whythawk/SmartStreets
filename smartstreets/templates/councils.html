Local councils with an active Business Improvement District
(BID) will benefit most from Pikhaya Smart Streets.

<p>
Local councils and BIDs receive structured analysis to 
improve the way they manage urban renewal projects and attract 
investment to their city. They can compare their retail and 
commercial tenant mix to other cities, and evaluate the impact 
of changes on occupancy over time. Adding in their footfall 
data can reveal how business activity varies with pedestrian 
density and potentially offer insight into new ways to 
attract people.
