<p>
Business seekers are individuals or small start-up companies 
looking for opportunities or premises where they can operate. 
These are independent entrepreneurs and not corporate-level 
businesses which would usually subscribe to more comprehensive
and expensive business intelligence services.
</p>
<p>
Business seekers receive free analysis on specific business
sites, links to available long- and short-term rentals, and
can search and filter both existing and vacant businesses by
revenue, rental cost and rental area. They can compare and
assess business revenue potential between different cities,
and create a custom profile to receive alerts related to
matching business opportunities, including sites offered for
long- and short-term leases.
